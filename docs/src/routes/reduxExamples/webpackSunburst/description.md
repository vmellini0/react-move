## Zoomable Sunburst

A zoomable sunburst of the webpack bundle for resonance.  Inspired by mbostock's [awesome example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373).
This example uses [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) to manage state and efficiently handle derived data.
You can zoom in, browse to another page and return and it will remain in the zoom state you left it in.
