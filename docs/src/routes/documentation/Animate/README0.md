## Animate  

The Animate component allows you to create complex animated transitions in React.
If you want to animate an array of items with entering and leaving transitions, you probably want to use the NodeGroup component.
The typical use case of the Animate component would be your data is a single object and you want to animate on enter and continue animating the state on subsequent updates.
